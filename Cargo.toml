# which has very slow performance on some platforms with opt-level 0,
# which is the default for dev and test builds.
# This slowdown causes certain interactions in the solana-test-validator,
# such as verifying ZK proofs in transactions, to take much more than 400ms,
# creating problems in the testing environment.
# To enable better performance in solana-test-validator during tests and dev builds,
# we override the opt-level to 3 for the crate.
